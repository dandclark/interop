# The Interop Project

Welcome to the project Interop 2022 and Interop 2023!

This project is part of [the web-platform-tests project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), and exist to make the web more interoperable in key areas, prioritized by web developer and user needs. See our [charter](./charter.md) for more on our scope.

The overall process and timeline for decision making is given by [wpt
RFC 99](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/interop_2022.md).

For each proposed Interop 2022 focus area:
 * First check for an existing issue covering that area. We are aiming
   to consolidate discussion for each proposal in a single issue.

* If no issue exists, file a new issue. The issue title should
   clearly describe the feature being proposed for inclusion. The body
   of the issue should outline the reason for including the issue and should include:

  - A link to the relevant specification document

  - A link to relevant test cases (assuming they exist)

  - Supporting data for including the feature as part of an interop
    effort e.g. evidence of significant developer interest in the
    feature, or evidence of site breakage caused by implementation
    differences in the feature.

  - Links to any existing discussion or vendor signals e.g. in browser
    project bug trackers.
