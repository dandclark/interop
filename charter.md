# Interop Team Charter

The Interop Team exists to make the web more interoperable in key areas, prioritized by web developer and user needs.

TODO: Why this is important, background with MDN DNA etc.

## Scope

TODO: Roughly, improving the interoperability of any "observable" web platform behavior.

TODO: Not writing specs as part of this team, but can work within regular working groups to get stuff done as necessary.

## Governance

The team will meet regularly, with agenda issues created in the repo at least 48 hours in advance, and meeting minutes posted in the issue.

The team makes decisions based on consensus, which is defined as support from at least two participating organizations and no opposition.

TODO: if individuals can participate, can they also object?

The Interop effort is subject to the [WPT code of conduct](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Substantive changes to this charter are done via the [web-platform-tests RFC process](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs).
