# Interop Team Charter

The Interop Team exists to make the web more interoperable in key areas, prioritized by web developer and user needs. This team is part of [the web-platform-tests project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), the main test suite for the web platform.

The team is responsible for maintaining [Compat 2021](https://wpt.fyi/compat2021), [Interop 2022](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022), and defining future interoperability efforts and metrics.

## Scope

The team works by prioritizing specific web platform features. The minimum requirements for a feature to be in scope are:

- The feature is defined, at least partially, by a specification developed by an organization like the W3C, WHATWG, TC39, Khronos, etc.
- The feature can be tested in a test suite like [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262), etc.

Browser features that don't affect web developers, like bookmarks, are out of scope.

Writing specifications is not in scope, but the team can liaise with and work within other working groups to make progress in key areas.

## Governance

The team makes decisions based on consensus, which is defined as support from at least two participating organizations and no opposition.

Decisions can be made both in the repository and in meetings, as long as consensus can be established. Meeting time and agenda should be announced at least 48 hours in advance, and meeting minutes posted in the repository.

The Interop effort is subject to the [WPT code of conduct](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Substantive changes to this charter are done via the [web-platform-tests RFC process](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs).
